sencha-context-objects
======================

An example of using context objects to scope and to type-hint events in Sencha Touch and Ext JS.

This repository contains an example Sencha Touch app to demonstrate the idea of context object for events.
It goes along with a lightning talk I gave at a Chicago Sencha meetup on July 17, 2014:
